    <p><strong>About Me:</strong></p>
    <p>What drew me into wanting to be a developer is that I get to use my problem solving skills as well as my artistic talents to develop code and applications that will help people and their businesses. I have always taken interest to computers and various software. It all started when I was a child running my trusty old Compaq PC on dial-up internet. I love art and I consider writing code as a sort of art-form; the amount of applications you can develop are endless.&nbsp;
	<br><br>I am a people person and being able to meet and work with others doing something that I love to do is just exciting for me. Working in a team and 
hearing ideas and input from people with different perspectives while collaborating on the same project really makes me passionate about development. I work just as well solo too.</p>
