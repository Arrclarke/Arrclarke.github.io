				<h2><b><u>Intro:</b></u></h2>
				<p> Hi! I am Ronda, and this is my Thinkful assignment for a developer portfolio! I live in Houston, TX and was born and raised here by two yankees. 
					Both of my parental units are from Buffalo, NY but they moved here before I was born. 
					</p>

				<h2><b><u>About Me:</b></u></h2>
				<p> What drew me into wanting to be a developer is that I get to use my problem solving skills as well as my artistic talents to
				develop code and applications that help people and their businesses. I have always taken interest to computers and various softwares
					since I was a child running on dial-up on my old trusty Compaq Presario. I love art and I consider writing code a sort of artform; the amount of
				applications you can develop are endless. I also enjoy playing musical instruments (I am a Jackie of all instruments but a master of none!), listening to music (every genre), as well as drawing, painting, or repurposing "ugly" things such as discarded or broken furniture. </p>
